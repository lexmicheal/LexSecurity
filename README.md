## Projects

Automated IP Allow List Management

Description:
Designed and Implemented an algorithm to automate the
management of an IP allow list (allow_list.txt) at my
organization. The project focused on ensuring secure
and efficient access control to restricted content by
identifying and removing unauthorized IP addresses
from the allow list.

[![Automation_Script](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Automation_Script-00A4EF?style=for-the-badge&logo=Microsoft&logoColor=white)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lexmicheal/LexSecurity/refs/heads/main/Automation_script.py?token=GHSAT0AAAAAAC545VDWLHVQYGP2BZNF6MIOZ44BDKA)


Key Features:

 Developed an algorithm to cross-reference allow_list.txt
 with a separate remove_list.txt file to identify outdated or
 unauthorized IP addesses.

 Automated the process of updating allow_list.txt by removing 
 flagged IP addresses.

 Ensured compliance with access control policies by maintaining
 an up-to-date allow list with minimal manual intervention.


## Tools and Technologies Used:

 Programming Language: Python

 File Handling Techniques: 

 
Results/Outcome:

 Eliminated manual errors and reduced the time required to
 update the IP allow list.

 Improved overall security by ensuring unautherized IP 
 addresses were promptly removed.

 Steamlined the process, resulting in a more secure and
 
efficient content access systems
