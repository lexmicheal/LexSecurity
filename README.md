Projects

Automated IP Allow List Management

Description:
Designed and Implemented an algorithm to automate the
management of an IP allow list (allow_list.txt) at my
organization. The project focused on ensuring secure
and efficient access control to restricted content by
identifying and removing unauthorized IP addresses
from the allow list.

Key Features:

 Developed an algorithm to cross-reference allow_list.txt
 with a separate remove_list.txt file to identify outdated or
 unauthorized IP addesses.

 Automated the process of updating allow_list.txt by removing 
 flagged IP addresses.

 Ensured compliance with access control policies by maintaining
 an up-to-date allow list with minimal manual intervention.

Tools and Technologies Used:

 Programming Language: Python

 File Handling Techniques: 

  open() & with statement: Used to open files in a clean and
  efficient manner, ensuring the file is properly closed after
  operations. Specifically, used the "w" mode to overwrite the
  allow_list.txt file with the updated content.
  
  readlines(): To read the content of allow_list.txt and 
  removed_list.txt as a lists of strings for processing.

  join(): To convert the list of updated IP addresses into
  a single string, using the ("\n") operator to ensure
  each IP address is written on a new line in the allow_list.txt
  file.

  write(): to overwrite allow_list.txt with the updated IP
  addressess. 

Results/Outcome:

 Eliminated manual errors and reduced the time required to
 update the IP allow list.

 Improved overall security by ensuring unautherized IP 
 addresses were promptly removed.

 Steamlined the process, resulting in a more secure and
 efficient content access systems.
